# Productive Vision Statement 
<hr/>
&emsp; Productive is an  phone app that allows the user  users to track and monitor their productivity through the use of a task system and a difficulty scale. Further, the app will appeal to the addictive nature of incrementing numbersincreasing one’s score and cosmetic rewards through the addition of ‘experience’ tracking. The theory is that the addition of these mechanics will add a no-cost incentive to becoming and remaining productive.

&emsp; Productive is an app that allows the user to track and monitor their productivity using a task system and a difficulty scale. The app will encourage and reward the user by gamifying the tasks that they define for themselves.  These mechanics will create the incentive necessary to encourage the user to keep on schedule, entirely for free. Most importantly, Productive makes both difficult and mundane tasks fun!

&emsp; Productive is an app for the common smartphone user. With today’s fast moving world, filled with distractions, Productive seeks to provide a satisfying anchor for the busy, the forgetful, and the distracted. The convenience of smartphones aids Productive’s ease-of-use while also creating the issue that led to its necessity. Students are a target in particular, as they are the largest audience for games and other distractions, while also being an audience that largely has smartphones to use the app.
 
&emsp; Productive is an app designed for those who may struggle with scheduling and self-motivation. In these uncertain times, with the increase in working-from-home, it is more arduous than ever for people to find a way to motivate themselves and stay on task. With today’s fast moving world, filled with distractions, staying on task is harder than ever. Productive seeks to provide a satisfying anchor for the busy, the forgetful, and the distracted. The accessibility of smartphones allows Productive to be readily available for the 4 billion worldwide smartphone users. Students are a target in particular, as they are the largest audience for games and other distractions, while also being an audience that largely has smartphones to use the app.

(Perhaps the user can select a “class” similar to RPGs. Maybe Student, Stay-at-home mom/dad, etc in order to further facilitate the exp system. My idea was that certain tasks can have a multiplier effect to provide additional exp based on the user’s class. Maybe this is just going to overcomplicate things but could also be a nice way to pair with the exp system. Students could gain more exp from assignments rather than doing the laundry, whereas a stay-at-home parent could gain more from the latter. Another benefit of picking a predetermined class is that we could actually have an idea of whether or not our app is actually being used widely by its target audience - the students. SDLC does have maintenance as one of its parts so if our user base seems to shift for whatever reason, this could be useful in order to gear our features to the wider user base. Just an idea lol)

&emsp; The app will use an experience system to generate a feeling of satisfaction in the user, even when the task completed was mundane, like taking out the garbage. The experience gain can also incentivise repeated task completion through the use of streaks. With a once-per-day requirement, the user can build up a multiplying streak to increase their experience gain, thus facilitating habit formation.

&emsp; A growing issue in the modern world is remaining on task with many surrounding distractions. Productive seeks to aid the users in the completion of their mundane or difficult tasks, such as doing the dishes or writing an essay, by attaching a visible value to the tasks in a similar way to how video games do. This gamifying of tasks will aid the user by making the tasks feel as satisfying as the other distractions available to them.

&emsp; The user will be able to manage their tasks and assign each an exp value system. The assignment of difficulty and completion will need to be done on a trust-based system, as to maximize the number of tasks the app can assist in gamifying. This means the application can be ‘tricked’ by creating many difficult tasks and completing them in rapid succession. As the app has no associated rewards or leaderboards for high ranked users, these users will not be inhibited by Productive’s design in any way because they are only ruining their own experience with the app. (Maybe the information provided in the above paragraph, regarding the app being tricked, isn’t too necessary in the vision statement, correct me if I’m wrong. Who, what and why has already been provided so far and the success criteria is provided below. I’m just not sure if this information fits into the requirements of the vision statement)

&emsp; The goal of the app is to reach as many people as possible. As such, the goal will be to achieve 100,000 regular users. The key success criteria will be the number of regular users. The number of total downloads would include many people who download the app because of it’s design and marketing, and thus would not properly portray the usefulness of the app to the users. If a user was to download the app and get bored of the mechanic after two days, then the number of regular users would remain the same and the number of downloads would go up, even though the user's experience was unsuccessful. It is because of this example we are choosing to have the app’s success be judged by the number of regular users over the number of downloads.
